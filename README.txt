In this project I spent 50% of time spent on solving the error and at the same time learning new things.
and rest of the time I spent on email mechanism.

I am successfully able to incarporate the email mechanism except automated email scheduler.
for this I wrote 'conjob.bat' file which is working properly, but for scheduling part I dont have domain space on server 
thats why I could not implement it in this project. still I have included those scripts in this zip folder.
for this I also tried to use windows task scheduler, but when the action gets triggered, it opens .php file and does not execute it.
So, I found out that I need to run that file on server only.

Apart from that I have impleted all the functionalites. 
 

And thank you for giving me an opportunity to learn php and mysql. This project inspired me a lot and now I going to learn 
php in depth.
I also figured out that I need to have more knowledge of HTML5,Css, javascript and json along with php.
